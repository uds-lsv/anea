# ANEA

ANEA is a tool to automatically annotate named entities in unlabeled text based on entity lists for the use as distant supervision.

An example of the workflow can be seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXwho2Pq6Eg). For the additional material of the PML4DC paper, please check the subdirectory *additional* of this repository.


## Installation
ANEA should run on all major operating systems. We recommend the installation via conda or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html):

```
git clone https://github.com/uds-lsv/anea

conda create -n anea python=3.7
conda activate anea
pip install spacy==2.2.4 Flask==1.1.1 fuzzywuzzy==0.18.0
```

For tokenizationa and lemmatization, a spacy language pack needs to be installed. Run the following command with the corresponding language code, e.g. en for English. Check https://spacy.io/usage for supported languages
```
python -m spacy download en
```

Download the Wikidata JSON dump from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/ and extract it to the *instance* directory (this may take a while).

## Running
After the installation, you can run ANEA using the following commands on the command line

```
conda activate anea
./run.sh
```

Then open the browser and go to the address *http://localhost:5000/* If you run it for the first time, you should configure ANEA at the *Settings* tab. 

The ANEA (server) tool can run on a different machine than the browser of the user. It is just necessary that the user's computer can access the port 5000 on the machine that the ANEA server is running on (e.g. via ssh port forwarding or opening the correspoding port on the firewall).

## Support for Other Languages

ANEA uses Spacy for language preprocessing (tokenization and lemmatization). It currently supports English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Greek, Norwegian Bokm√•l and Lithuanian. For Estonian, [EstNLTK](https://github.com/estnltk/estnltk}), version 1.6, is supported by ANEA. In that case, ANEA needs to be installed with Python 3.6. 

Text can also be preprocessed using external tools and then uploaded as whitespace tokenized text or in the CoNLL format (one token per line).

Other external preprocessing libraries can be added directly to ANEA by implementing a new Tokenizer class in autom_labeling_library/preprocessing.py (you can take a look at EstnltkTokenizer as an example) and adding it to the Preprocessing class. If you encounter any issues, just contact us.
